How does LLM work?
It works on prediction.
LLM (Large Language Model) works by using deep learning techniques to analyze and generate human-like text. It is trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing it to learn grammar, facts, and context. The model uses a transformer architecture, which enables it to understand relationships between words and generate coherent responses.

The process typically involves the following steps:

1. Pre-training: The model is trained on a diverse dataset to learn language patterns and structures. This phase helps the model develop a general understanding of language.

2. Fine-tuning: After pre-training, the model is further trained on specific tasks or domains. This helps it adapt to particular use cases, such as chatbots or content generation.

3. Inference: When a user inputs a prompt, the model processes the text and generates a response by predicting the next word or sequence of words. It uses attention mechanisms to focus on relevant context and produce coherent output.

Overall, LLMs leverage large-scale data and advanced neural network architectures to understand and generate human-like text, making them powerful tools for various applications.


As a pure language model, I predicted the answer based on learned patterns from training data, rather than performing actual arithmetic like a calculator.

Even for simple math like 2 + 2, I generate the answer by predicting the most likely continuation.

Technically, as a language model, I predict the answer based on patterns learned during training. I donâ€™t perform arithmetic the way a calculator does.
